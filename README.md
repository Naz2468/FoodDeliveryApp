# FoodDeliveryApp
1. We Set Up A New Project
First, we make sure we have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on our computer. We then create a new Java project in our preferred IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans).

2. Basic Project Structure
We create the following files in your project:

FoodDeliveryApp.java (main application class)
MainFrame.java (the main window of the app)
MenuPanel.java (to display the food menu)
OrderPanel.java (to handle orders)
3.  We Create a class FoodDeliveryApp.java
This class will be the entry point for the application.
 4. We Create a class MainFrame.java
This will be the main window of your application.
5. We Create a class MenuPanel.java
This panel will display the food menu and allow users to add items to their order.
6. We Create a class OrderPanel.java
This panel will show the order summary and allow users to place the order
7. We Run the Application
We compile and run the application. You should see a window with a menu on the left and an order summary on the right. Clicking on menu items should add them to the order summary, and you should be able to place the order using the "Place Order" button.
